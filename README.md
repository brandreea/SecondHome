SecondHome is a prototype for a Romanian re-homing service. In this repository, only the mobile app can be found.


This app provides its users the further features:

  - Ability to create an account or log into one, as a part of the community;
  - Ability to view pets that are here for adoption, as well as post a pet if you are looking forward to finding them a loving home;
  - View the locations in which some of the pets are being sheltered;
  - Contact the SecondHome Team through the Contact Feature;
